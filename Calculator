# This program will take an input of two numbers and an operator and do calculations

from random import randint

# This variable will store the user manual for the tool. Triple quotes can be used to make a block string like this:
documentation = '''

This program takes a string from the user in the format of:
(number) (operator) (number)
The program will then use the operator to chose what math operation to do to the numbers.
Recognized operators are as follows (seperated by commas in the case of multiple symbols for the same operation):
+ = addition
- = subtraction
x, X, * = multiplication
/ = division
++ = concatenation
? = will give you a random number in a range between the two entered numbers
